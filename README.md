The project was about finding what drives the price of the car. I also used the sample size 10,000 since it gets a proper data snapshot and the code runs effectively. In this project, It was clear we had to do importance. Initially, I did permutation importance, but it took a very long time for the code to run, so I used RandomForestRegressor to run the importance, and it shows that the year has the highest impact on prices. Then, I chose type as the subcategory of what leads to higher prices since real-world car buyers look into the types of cars when looking for the best price in that category. It shows that type 5 is the cheapest of the new cars. I did a time series using age as the vehicle manufacturers every year, and it shows how prices, in general, rise yearly. However, the most critical takeaway for the client is to check the updates in predicted prices as they rise every year, frequently monitor the market of car prices, and check the type of car to maintain the best prices for the new vehicle on sale. The project is in the Master branch.
